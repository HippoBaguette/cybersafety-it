          You can connect with friends, family, peers or like minded people. On top of that most social networks
          are free. Discord also allows users to voice chat with their friends again, for free. Discord just require you to be 13

        <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
        <pre>
          Discord can allow you to connect with friends, but also with total strangers. Discord advertises this
          as communities, though to some people it's an experience with random people from some random country.

          And like most social networks, people look at the content posted. Users can send media/messages that
          may offend some users. This is of course with the intention of doing so. For example, racist comments.
          They are made to offend a group of people.
